# Locational Knowledge Base - LKB

LKB is a webapp designed to simplify the process of sharing knowledge that is tied to a specific location. 

The design goal for this system was to eliminate the need for integration with other systems as it is already very hard to introduce new software in some companies. Instead, I opted for a standalone system that can be used as a web-app. It will load related notes based on the user's location. 

### Features
- Create a pin on map, add related notes and pictures to it.
- Share your notes with other people in your group/company.
- Browse the map or scan your location for nearby pins.
